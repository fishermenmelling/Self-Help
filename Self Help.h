 ATONEMENT
 
 (Do good BECAUSE of my salvation) && !(FOR my salvation)

 Pure doctrine of christ
 Pure revelation
 Pure truth
 
 !(judging others)
 
 The holier you become the more you care about what...
  
 It is doctrinally incorrect to refer to the sacrifice as the atonement ||… (look up conference talk to find out how to refer to the atonement)

 Raise awareness
 “I will go && do?” vs. “How is it possible?”
 No short cuts
 We worship a waiting god
 We must have a change of attitude
