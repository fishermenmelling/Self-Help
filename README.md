# Self-Help Questionaire
  
  
  The program asks the user how they feel and gives them options. The user then types the number next to the answer they feel best describes their mood.
  The program will output an answer that it feels will help the user's current mood.
  This is just something I wanted to do for myself and anyone else who thinks they could benifit from it as well.
